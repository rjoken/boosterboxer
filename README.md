# boosterboxer
A Yu-Gi-Oh! pack opening simulator.

You will need to include the packs database file in the build folder in order for the program to function. This file can be found [here](http://clefable.net/booster/sets.db)

For those who prefer to have a prebuilt binary with the database included, you can get that [here](http://clefable.net/booster/BoosterBoxer.zip)

Simply select a booster set, a number of packs to open, and open! You can sort your pulls before exporting to a text file, then do with the pull information as you please. 
This could be used to set up fun duels on any simulator program you may like to play the game on. :)

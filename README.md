# boosterboxer
A Yu-Gi-Oh! pack opening simulator.

For those who prefer to have a prebuilt binary, you can get that [here](http://clefable.net/booster/BoosterBoxer.zip)

Simply select a booster set, a number of packs to open, and open! You can sort your pulls before exporting to a text file, then do with the pull information as you please. 
This could be used to set up fun duels on any simulator program you may like to play the game on. :)
